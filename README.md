# Live-Project

Summary of tasks completed during the duration of this project:
-Log into unknown admin, user accounts
-Access confidential documents, data
-Escalate user privileges
-Edit website content
-Analyze PCAP files
-Identify malware type, source
-Trace path of system infection
-Audit security alert logs

Summary of skills demonstrated throughout this project:

Ethical hacking skills: 
-SQL injection; ‘ or 1=1 –; Bypassing login credentials
-Exploit broken anti-automation vulnerabilities: Bypass CAPTCHA; Submit multiple HTTP requests - Positions, Payloads
-Brute force attack: Modifying code in HTTP POST requests
-Privilege escalation: Modifying in HTTP requests
-Sensitive data exposure
-Directory transversal attack
-Broken access control
-Null byte injection: %00, %2500

Attack mitigation techniques:
-Encrypt data both at rest and in transit using a secure protocol
-Implement access control mechanisms:  Restrict access to certain directories and files with Access Control Lists
-Use multi-factor authentication
-Validate, filter, and sanitize all client-provided data
-Define data types and strict patterns for all string parameters

Analyze network traffic packets:
-Trace source(s) and path of infection: IP and MAC addresses, Domain and Host names, Windows user account, Ports and protocols involved
-Identify instances of malicious traffic: Suspicious file attributes, source addresses, and communication flags
-Investigate cause of security alerts
-Apply static and dynamic analysis techniques
-Audit CLI logs: Identify malicious command executions, Keylogging scripts
-Linux-based security exploits: enumeration, privilege escalation
